### Function 4: Alert 
This function is used give a alert message to users to which table is occupied for too long. The time limit can afjust by users.

## Function 5: Edit
This function is used to edit the size and number of table.

### Function 5 (if we have enough time): splitting and combination of the table
This function is used in the situation that there are a large amount of customers and multiple table is needed to combine or split for serving purposes;

A menu will be created to list out all the function and allow users to choose which to use. More functions may be added later

## Problem setting
In this project, we are assuming the size of our shop is unlimited, so we can adjust the number of the table and seat. In a basic structure, there will be 4 sizes of the table (2,4,8...etc) and each of them is used to serve different type of customers. Puse, we are assuming the customers may not have different requirement on the table, such as Non smoking area or area specially for male/female/baby. Of coures, we may modify our program to meet the requirement if we have time.
